## Plan 

Based on LBA2 IdaJS modding engine, create an extended version for LBA2 game, that would contain:
- new side quests
- new NPCs
- new inventory items
- possibilities to solve existing quests in different way.

Other than that, this project can be a good source of examples of the advanced modding with IdaJS.

**Current status of the project:** very beginning and experiments.
